# GPS 1.1 Reflection

Overall, I feel I'm getting the hang of Git.  Adding, committing, making a pull request, and merging to the master branch makes sense to me in theory and it will continue to get easier as I repeat the process.  Fetch is still a mystery to me, but I think this will resolve itself as we use the command in future modules.  Cloning was somewhat foreign before the session, and it was clarified through working with Joel and James.

I had questions about encoutering merge conflicts and how to deal with them, and this was resolved before the session concluded.  Joel was having some difficulty with Github recognizing that I invited him to be a contributor in the repo, even though it was showing on my account.

My first GPS pairing session went extremely well (although I personally began to run out of gas towards the end).  Joel and I seemed to have a good rapport, and James was present without being too instrusive.  I look forward to working with them both again.
