# Reflection on GPS 1.1

I was struggling with the concept of push, especially regarding whether to use it from the master or from a branch when pushing to the GitHub repository. 

This was clarified for me, as well as the need to have the online and local masters in sync for smooth functioning of the workflow. 

I asked about push, and we explored that together. Rob and I asked questions and checked in with one another frequently, so nailing down a specific broader question is hard. I'd say we checked in a lot about what the correct next step is and how to word commits. 

I'm getting the hang of the pattern of the work, but am still confused on `fetch` versus `pull`, and how the website side of things works. Though I had been invited as a collaborator it took until much later in the day for the repository to show on my personal page. 

This first session was awesome! Rob was collected and I felt like we were evenly willing to search for answers to our stumbling blocks. He's a good Googler already. I thought James, our guide, was quiet but responsive. He answered direct questions, but still let us find our own solutions.
